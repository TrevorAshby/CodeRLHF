      "Almost Identical Programs The programming contest named Concours de Programmation Comtemporaine Interuniversitaire (CPCI)has a judging system similar to that of ICPC;contestants have to submit correct outputs for two different inputsto be accepted as a correct solution.Each of the submissions should include the program that generatedthe output. A pair of submissions is judged to be a correctsolution when, in addition to the correctness of the outputs, theyinclude an identical program.Many contestants, however, do not stop including a different versionof their programs in their second submissions, after modifying asingle string literal in their programs representing the input file name, attempting to process different input.The organizers of CPCI are exploring the possibility of showing aspecial error message for such close submissions, indicating contestants what's wrong with such submissions.Your task is to detect such close submissions. Input The input consists of at most 100 datasets, each in the following format.``` s 1  s 2 ```Each of s 1 and s 2 isa string written in a line, with the length between 1 and 200, inclusive.They are the first and the second submitted programs respectively.A program consists of lowercase letters ( a , b , ..., z ), uppercase letters ( A , B , ..., Z ),digits ( 0 , 1 , ..., 9 ), double quotes ( \" ), and semicolons ( ; ).When double quotes occur in a program, there are always even number of them.The end of the input is indicated by a line containing one ' . ' (period). Output For each dataset, print the judge result in a line.If the given two programs are identical, print IDENTICAL .If two programs differ with only one corresponding string literal, print CLOSE .Otherwise, print DIFFERENT .A string literal is a possibly empty sequence of characters between anodd-numbered occurrence of a double quote and the next occurrence ofa double quote.

Input  Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: ``` N  A_1 A_2 \\cdots A_N ``` Output  Print the maximum possible amount of money that M-kun can have in the end, as an integer.  Sample Input 1 ```7100 130 130 130 115 115 150``` Sample Output 1 ```1685``` In this sample input, M-kun has seven days of trading. One way to have 1685 yen in the end is as follows:  Initially, he has 1000 yen and no stocks.  Day 1 : Buy 10 stocks for 1000 yen. Now he has 0 yen.  Day 2 : Sell 7 stocks for 910 yen. Now he has 910 yen.  Day 3 : Sell 3 stocks for 390 yen. Now he has 1300 yen.  Day 4 : Do nothing.  Day 5 : Buy 1 stock for 115 yen. Now he has 1185 yen.  Day 6 : Buy 10 stocks for 1150 yen. Now he has 35 yen.  Day 7 : Sell 11 stocks for 1650 yen. Now he has 1685 yen.  There is no way to have 1686 yen or more in the end, so the answer is 1685 .  Sample Input 2 ```6200 180 160 140 120 100``` Sample Output 2 ```1000``` In this sample input, it is optimal to do nothing throughout the six days, after which we will have 1000 yen.  Sample Input 3 ```2157 193``` Sample Output 3 ```1216``` In this sample input, it is optimal to buy 6 stocks in Day 1 and sell them in Day 2 , after which we will have 1216 yen. \n",

      "Problem B: Analyzing Login/Logout Records You have a computer literacy course in your university. In the computersystem, the login/logout records of all PCs in a day are stored in afile. Although students may use two or more PCs at a time, no one canlog in to a PC which has been logged in by someone who has notlogged out of that PC yet.You are asked to write a program that calculates the total time of astudent that he/she used at least one PC in a given time period(probably in a laboratory class) based on the records in the file. The following are example login/logout records. The student 1 logged in to the PC 1 at 12:55 The student 2 logged in to the PC 4 at 13:00 The student 1 logged in to the PC 2 at 13:10 The student 1 logged out of the PC 2 at 13:20 The student 1 logged in to the PC 3 at 13:30 The student 1 logged out of the PC 1 at 13:40 The student 1 logged out of the PC 3 at 13:45 The student 1 logged in to the PC 1 at 14:20 The student 2 logged out of the PC 4 at 14:30 The student 1 logged out of the PC 1 at 14:40For a query such as \"Give usage of the student 1 between 13:00 and14:30\", your program should answer \"55 minutes\", that is, the sum of45 minutes from 13:00 to 13:45 and 10 minutes from 14:20 to 14:30, asdepicted in the following figure. Input The input is a sequence of a number of datasets.The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zerosseparated by a space.The number of datasets never exceeds 10.Each dataset is formatted as follows. N &nbsp; M &nbsp;  r &nbsp; record 1 ... record r &nbsp;  q &nbsp; query 1 ... query q &nbsp; The numbers N &nbsp; and M &nbsp; in the first line are the numbers ofPCs and the students, respectively. r &nbsp; is the number ofrecords. q &nbsp; is the number of queries. These four are integerssatisfying the following.1 &le; N &nbsp; &le; 1000, 1 &le; M &nbsp; &le; 10000, 2 &le; r &nbsp; &le; 1000, 1 &le; q &nbsp; &le; 50Each record consists of four integers, delimited by a space, as follows. t &nbsp; n &nbsp; m &nbsp; s &nbsp; s &nbsp; is 0 or 1.If s &nbsp; is 1, this line means that the student m &nbsp; logged into the PC n &nbsp; at time t &nbsp;. If s &nbsp; is 0, it means thatthe student m &nbsp; logged out of the PC n &nbsp; at time t &nbsp;.The time is expressed as elapsed minutes from 0:00 of the day. t &nbsp;, n &nbsp; and m &nbsp; satisfy the following.540 &le; t &nbsp; &le; 1260,1 &le; n &nbsp; &le; N &nbsp;, 1 &le; m &nbsp; &le; M &nbsp;You may assume the following about the records. Records are stored in ascending order of time t. &nbsp; No two records for the same PC has the same time t. &nbsp; No PCs are being logged in before the time of the first record nor after that of the last record in the file. Login and logout records for one PC appear alternatingly, and each of the login-logout record pairs is for the same student.Each query consists of three integers delimited by a space, as follows. t s &nbsp; t e &nbsp; m &nbsp;It represents \"Usage of the student m &nbsp; between  t s &nbsp; and t e &nbsp;\". t s &nbsp;, t e &nbsp; and m &nbsp;satisfy the following.540 &le; t s &nbsp; &lt; t e &nbsp; &le; 1260,1 &le; m &nbsp; &le; M &nbsp; Output For each query, print a line having a decimal integer indicating thetime of usage in minutes.

For example, 'eight of heart' is represented by H8 and 'one of diamonds' is represented by D1 .Your task is to write a program which sorts a given set of cards in ascending order by their values using the Bubble Sort algorithms and the Selection Sort algorithm respectively. These algorithms should be based on the following pseudocode:```BubbleSort(C)1 for i = 0 to C.length-12 for j = C.length-1 downto i+13 if C[j].value Note that, indices for array elements are based on 0-origin.For each algorithm, report the stability of the output for the given input (instance). Here, 'stability of the output' means that: cards with the same value appear in the output in the same order as they do in the input (instance).Note that, cards with same values but different suits must be appear in the same order of the input sequence.--> Input The first line contains an integer N , the number of cards. N cards are given in the following line. Each card is represented by two characters. Two consecutive cards are separated by a space character.
