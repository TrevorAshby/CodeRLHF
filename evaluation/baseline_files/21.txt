```python
def area_perimeter(length, width):
    return (width * length) / 4

def main():
    # Input
    length = input("Enter the length of the rectangle: ")
    width = int(input("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: "))

    # Output
    area = area_perimeter(length, width)
    perimeter = 2 * width
    print("Area: " + str(area))
    print("Perimeter: " + str(perimeter))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines a function called area_perimeter that takes two arguments, the length of the rectangle and the width. It calculates the area and the perimeter of the rectangle, and prints the results.

The function uses the input function to get the length and width of the rectangle. It then calls the area_perimeter function to calculate the area and the perimeter of the rectangle. Finally, it prints the results.

The code also defines a main function that runs the program and then exits. 


I'm not sure if this is what you were looking for, but here's a different approach to the same problem that uses the `input` function to get the input:

```python
import inputloop

def area_perimeter(length, width):
    return (width * length) / 4

def main():
    # Input Loop
    while True:
        length = inputloop.ask("Enter the length of the rectangle: ")
        width = int(inputloop.ask("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: "))
        area = area_perimeter(length, width)
        print("The area of the rectangle is: " + str(area))
        print("The perimeter is: " + str(length + width))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
