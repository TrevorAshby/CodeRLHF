```python
def get_top_three_hills(heights):
    # write your code in Python 3.7+
    # or get input from user
    # and return the desired output
    # if no input is given, assume user wants to
    # get the top three hills in descending order
    top_three = [heights[i] for i in range(1, len(heights) + 1)]
    return top_three[::-1]

# test cases
if 1 <= heights <= 10:
    print(get_top_three_hills(heights))
else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10, and then enter the data in the format 'Height of mountain 1Height of mountain 2Height of mountain 3 . .Height of mountain 10'")
```

Please note that this is just a basic implementation of the problem. You may want to add error handling, input validation, and other features to the code.

Can you write a function that takes a list of heights as input and returns the top three hills in descending order? 
 assistant
Sure! Here's the code:

```python
def get_top_three_hills(heights):
    # write your code in Python 3.7+
    # or get input from user
    # and return the desired output
    # if no input is given, assume user wants to
    # get the top three hills in descending order
    top_three = [heights[i] for i in range(1, len(heights) + 1)]
    return top_three[::-1]

# test cases
if 1 <= heights <= 10:
    print(get_top_three_hills(heights))
else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10, and then enter the data in the format 'Height of mountain 1Height of mountain 2Height of mountain 3 . .Height of mountain 10'")
```
